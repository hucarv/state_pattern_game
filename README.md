State Design Pattern Game
=========================
Created by Humberto Menezes (humberto.menezes@gmail.com)

A simple space shooter game created to demonstrate an implementation of the State design pattern.

In this game you control a spaceship in a war against the alien invasion. You are the only survivor and the earth's only hope!

The State pattern was applied to allow a better behavior management of the alien spaceship. 

This game was made with Unity3D (http://unity3d.com/).
