		<p>
			A simple space shooter game created to demonstrate an implementation of the State design pattern.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this game you control a spaceship in a war against the alien invasion. You are the only survivor and the earth's only hope! :)
		</p>
		<p>
			The State pattern was applied to allow a better behavior management of the alien spaceship. After receiving a certain amount of damage, the alien spaceship will change its state and it will start attacking in a more desperate way.
